The main dbBact server is running at: [dbbact.org](dbbact.org).

The dbBact API is available at: api.dbbact.org

## Installation:
<test class="warning">
We strongly recommend using the main running dbBact server (api.dbbact.org).

By locally installing dbBact, the local installation will not be synchronized with the main dbBact server.
</test>

However, you may want to locally install dbBact in order to test new functions, or to run local queries.

1. dbBact server interfaces with a postgres SQL database containing the actual data. dbBact requires postgres 9.3 or higher. postgres can be obtained [here](https://www.postgresql.org/).

2. Create the dbBact conda environment:
```
 conda create -n dbbact2 python=3.6 numpy matplotlib scipy jupyter statsmodels

 source acticate dbbact
 ```

3. install more required python packages:

  ```pip install flask-cors
  
  pip install image
  
  pip install git+git://github.com/amueller/word_cloud
  
  pip install psycopg2
 ```
3. Clone the dbbact github repository
  git clone
